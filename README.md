##### Pros/Cons of DBaaS and DIY approach

DIY Pros:

- Full control over what is happening
- Cheaper in terms of $$
- Can optimize further than DBaaS if the needed specs are known, which would bring the costs down even more

DIY Cons:

- Initial setup to get everything up and running takes longer
- Costlier in terms of working hours spent
- Maintenance has many aspects to consider, which DBaaS would automate:
  - Backups
  - Security aspects like encryption
  - Scalability

DBaaS Pros:

- Easy to get started
- Automatic scalability
- High availability
- Less manual labour, more productivity hours
- Tempting integration with other services if using multiple services from the same provider

DBaaS Cons:

- Costlier
- No control over performance should the service provider start acting up
- Vendors encourage committing to a single provider by offering bulk/long term client -discounts
- Risk of vendor lock from said tempting integrations

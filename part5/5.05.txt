OpenShift vs Rancher

- Rancher is open source
- Rancher is lighter to run due to less "bloat" included
- Rancher uses regular Kubernetes, and OpenShift uses OKD (very opinionated k8s deployment)
- Because of that Rancher can be further kustomized to fit specific needs
- Rancher is easy to get started with but later has less hand holding which can become an issue
- OpenShift requires an expensive licence to run
- OpenShift is in the closed Red Hat ecosystem
- OpenShift offers useful tooling out of the box
